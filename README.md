## 🚀 About Me

I’m a **Senior QA Automation Engineer and Delivery Lead** with **12+ years** of experience ensuring quality, reliability, and release confidence across enterprise web, API, cloud, and transactional platforms.

I specialize in designing and **scaling QA automation frameworks**, leading UAT and release validation, and embedding automated testing into CI/CD pipelines to deliver predictable, high-quality software.

In recent years, I’ve actively incorporated **AI-assisted and agentic QA practices—leveraging tools** like **Claude AI (MCP Agents)** and **GitHub Copilot** to optimize test generation, framework maintenance, debugging, and regression efficiency.

I’ve contributed to platforms serving **50M+ global users** and delivered **120+ production releases** with zero **Sev-1 defects**, working closely with cross-functional teams across **US, UK, EU, and Middle East regions**.
